# DFA Minimizer

**Description:**
DFA Minimizer is a Python-based tool designed to minimize Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) using the Myhill-Nerode algorithm. This project provides a user-friendly GUI (Graphical User Interface) implemented with the Tkinter library for ease of interaction. DFA diagrams are visualized using the visual-automata library, providing a clear representation of the minimized DFAs.

**Key Features:**
- Minimization of DFAs using the Myhill-Nerode algorithm.
- Graphical user interface for intuitive interaction.
- Visual representation of DFA diagrams for enhanced understanding.

**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `https://github.com/Asfand0007/DFA-Minimizer.git`.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):
   - On Linux/Unix:
     ```
     python3 -m venv env          # Create virtual environment
     source env/bin/activate      # Activate virtual environment
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```
     python -m venv env           # Create virtual environment
     .\env\Scripts\activate       # Activate virtual environment
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the main script using `python main.py`.
5. Utilize the GUI to input DFAs and observe their minimization.

**Graphviz Installation:**
Sometimes, the `graphviz` Python package may encounter issues, requiring you to install Graphviz separately and add it to your environment PATH variables. Here's how you can do it:
- Download and install Graphviz from the official website: [Graphviz Download](https://www.graphviz.org/download/)
- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
- After installing Graphviz, add its bin directory to your system's PATH environment variable. This allows Python to locate Graphviz executables.
- For detailed instructions on adding Graphviz to PATH, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/command.html#installation).
